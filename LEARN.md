Platform Starter is a powerful boilerplate for building web applications using React.js. It comes packed with essential tools and libraries to streamline your development process.

### Features 
Platform Starter embraces the Atomic UI design system, which encourages the use of atomic components for building interfaces. Atomic UI promotes reusability and modularity by breaking down the UI into smaller, self-contained components.
Ant Design Integration

The starter incorporates Ant Design, a widely-used UI library that provides a rich collection of pre-designed components and styles. With Ant Design, you can create elegant and consistent user interfaces effortlessly.
React Router

React Router is seamlessly integrated into the starter, enabling smooth navigation and routing within your application. Define routes, handle dynamic URLs, and effortlessly switch between different views to create a fluid user experience.
Redux Toolkit for State Management

Managing state in React applications is made easy with Redux Toolkit, included in this starter. It simplifies complex state logic, providing a predictable and centralized way to handle data flow. Redux Toolkit reduces boilerplate code and offers debugging utilities like Redux DevTools.
Well-Organized Structure

Platform Starter follows a well-organized project structure that separates concerns and promotes code maintainability. Key directories include:

    Components: Shared and reusable UI components, not specific to one layout or interface.
    Layouts: Main layout structures for the interfaces.
    Pages: Individual pages/views of the application. Each page has its folder containing reusable components specific to that page and its styling.
    Services: Handles interactions with internal APIs, third-party APIs, and business logic.
    Store: Configuration and management of the application's state.
    Hooks: Custom hooks to reuse stateful logic.

Vite Build Tool

Vite, a fast and lightweight build tool designed for modern JavaScript frameworks like React, is included. It offers near-instantaneous development server startup and blazing-fast hot module replacement (HMR).
Theme Configuration

Platform Starter allows for fully configurable theming through a JSON file using Ant Design v5's full features. Configure your theme effortlessly to match your project's aesthetics.
