# Overview
Platform Starter is a starter boilerplate for building web applications using React.js, equipped with a powerful set of tools and libraries to streamline development process

**Key Features :**

 - Atomic UI: The starter embraces the Atomic UI design system, which
   encourages the use of atomic components for building interfaces.
   Atomic UI promotes reusability and modularity by breaking down the UI
   into smaller, self-contained components
 - Ant Design: The starter incorporates Ant Design, a widely-used UI
   library that offers a rich collection of pre-designed components and
   styles
 - React Router: React Router is integrated into the starter, enabling seamless navigation and routing within the application. It allows you
   to define routes, handle dynamic URLs, and easily switch between
   different views
 - Redux Toolkit: Redux Toolkit simplifies state management in React applications. It's included in the starter to manage complex state logic, providing a predictable and centralized way to handle data flow. Redux Toolkit reduces boilerplate code and offers utilities
  like Redux DevTools for debugging
 - Well-Separated Structure: The starter follows a well-organized
   structure that separates concerns and promotes code maintainability
 - Build Tool: Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool specifically
   designed for modern JavaScript frameworks like React. It offers near-
   instantaneous development server startup and blazing-fast hot module
   replacement (HMR)

## Project Structure 

- Components : Shared and reusable UI components (Not Specific to
one Layout or one Interface)
- Layouts: Main Layout structure for the interfaces
- Pages : Individual pages / views of the application .  Each Page will have itâ€™s own folder containing the reusable components
that are specific to that page and styling 
- Services: interaction with Internal APIs , 3d party APIs , and handling
business logic .
- Store : Configuration and management of the application state .
- Hooks: custom hooks to reuse our stateful logic.
